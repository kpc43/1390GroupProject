Description:
The idea is that we will give the program two inputs. One of Waldo himself and the other will be the photo where waldo is hidden somewhere. The program will comb through each person and compare it to the input photo of Waldo. It will keep on searching until Waldo is found and then create a red rectangle/circle where he is, and output a picture of where he is.

Milestones:
  1. Research and review lectures for how to approach project (Lecture 16 seems to have facial recognition)
  2. Create folders of Where's Waldo images and images of Waldo to reference
  3. Create facial recognition software to find Waldo in a given image
  4. Test with Where's Waldo images
  5. Preparing final presentation 
  6. Final Presentation 11/17
