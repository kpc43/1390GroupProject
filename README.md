Description:
The idea is that we will give the program two inputs. One of Waldo himself and the other will be the photo where waldo is hidden somewhere. The program will comb through each person and compare it to the input photo of Waldo. It will keep on searching until Waldo is found and then create a red rectangle/circle where he is, and output a picture of where he is.

Milestones:
  1.
